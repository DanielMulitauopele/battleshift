## Introduction 

Battleshift serves as a brownfield project for students  to get acquainted with diving into already existing code. Students were tasked with sifting through an unruly codebase to pull out the essence of an API based game, Battleship. While attempting to understand the game logic, students were also pushed to fully grasp how API requests work, as well as understand mailers in Rails.
